In the beginning was The Script, and The Script was JavaScript.
And The Script was without Types, and void.
And God said, Let there be Types: and there were Types.
And God saw the Types, that they were good: and God divided the Typed from the Untyped.
And God called this TypeScript. And it was gradually Typed.
And God said, Let the Types be turing complete.
And God made the Types a typed lambda calculus: and it was so.
God looked upon his creation and saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it gave him massive blue balls. This was very good.
