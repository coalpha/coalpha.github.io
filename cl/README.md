# common lisp

### thoughts pasted from discord

- overall thoughts on lisp
- it feels like it has the potential to be a much more functional language than it is
- the varargs don't help, I must say
- varargs are kinda stupid
- if you need variadic arguments, no you don't
- you need a list
- macros are an easier to reach abstraction
- and feel much more natural than other languages
- it's true that the language is a lot more extensible than anything else I've used
- by making the syntax essentially non-existent, nothing is special
- originally, I didn't like the idea of dynamic typing
- but it sorta just works without a hitch
- now here's where the gripes come in
- common lisp is not widely used
- and as such, script kiddying is rather hard to do
- looking up stuff for f# was easy and accessible
- not so much for common lisp
- the evaluation context was strange
- I must say that I'm not really one to enjoy repl based languages
- or repl based evaluation contexts
- so that would be stuff like jupyter
- etc
- I like thinking about stuff as file -> run
- in it's own kinda instance
- honestly, it's really not that much different than javascript
- no, actually it's identical
- so I'm not really sure what I'm complaining about here
- well, anyways, it felt a little strange to me that the repl would keep running after my program was done
- unless I (exit)
- I think the people that talk about this like it's some godly language are high off their own supply
- it's simple, I'll give it that
- it has a much more coherent mental model of how the language works than a whole lot of other stuff
- people kept saying that I should learn lisp and that it'll blow my mind
- the hype has not delivered
- I understood the basic concept before I learned lisp and this is exactly how I felt it would work
- I am nonplussed
